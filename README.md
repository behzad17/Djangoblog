## Project Revisions & Resubmission Based on Feedback

This section outlines all improvements made after initial feedback, documenting the actions taken to address each issue before resubmitting the project for reassessment.

### 1. Full UI Customization

- Originally, the site looked very similar to the walkthrough project.
- Action Taken:
  - The navbar, colors, and menu styles were redesigned to reflect a unique identity
  - Added card-based design for post previews with shadows and borders

  - The comment form now renders properly and saves updates
  - Local testing confirmed successful edit functionality
  - Added user feedback messages for successful edits

## Agile Methodology & Project Board

This project was managed using **GitHub Projects** with a Kanban workflow.  
The board included **four main stages**:

1. **Backlog** ‚Üí All planned user stories before development.
2. **Ready** ‚Üí Items prepared and ready to be picked up.
3. **In Progress** ‚Üí Items actively being developed.
4. **Done** ‚Üí Completed items, fully implemented and tested.

## Conclusion

By using Agile methodology with a **Kanban board** on GitHub Projects,  
I was able to track progress visually through each stage of development ‚Äî from planning to completion.

 

###  Wireframes  

As part of the design process, created  I wireframes for the main pages of the application.  
The wireframes helped visualizing the layout, content structure, and user flow before implementing the actual UI.  

#### üîπ Main Page (Landing Page)  
- Logo and navigation menu at the top (Home, About, Login, Register).  
- A central heading: *‚ÄúRead it on our website‚Äù* i completed the text now.  
- Grid of blog/article cards with:  
  - Image placeholder  
  - Title (bold text)  
  - Short description/preview text  
- Designed for quick content scanning and responsive layout. 

####  Login Page  
- **Fields**: Email, Password  
- **Action**: Login button  
- **Notes**:  to allow registered users to access their profiles.  

####  Register Page  
- **Fields**: Username, Email, Password, Confirm Password  
- **Action**: Sign Up button  
- **Validation**: Password requirements listed (minimum length, not common, not numeric only, etc.)  
- **Notes**: Focused on user-friendly and secure registration.  

####  Blog Post + Comment Page  
- **Sections**:  
  - Blog title and content area  
  - Author info and timestamp  
  - Comment section with input box and "Add Comment" button  
- **Notes**: Designed to encourage user interaction with clear placement of content and comments.  

 **Wireframe Examples:**

###  Color Scheme & Typography  

####  Color Scheme  
The application uses a **clean and modern color palette** to ensure readability and accessibility:  

- **Primary Color:** `#0077b6` ‚Üí Used for buttons, highlights, and navigation links  
- **Secondary Color:** `#00b4d8` ‚Üí Supporting accents and hover states  
- **Background Color:** `#ffffff` ‚Üí Clean white background for maximum readability  
- **Text Color:** `#000000` ‚Üí Standard black for strong contrast  
- **Border/Muted Elements:** `#e0e0e0` ‚Üí Used for card borders and subtle separation  


####  Typography  
For typography, a **modern sans-serif font** was selected for simplicity and readability across devices:  

- **Headings (H1, H2, H3):** `Poppins` (Bold, clean, easy to read)  
- **Body Text:** `Roboto` (Regular, highly readable on screens)  
- **Fallback Fonts:** `Arial, sans-serif`  

 This combination ensures that titles stand out while body text remains clear and user-friendly.  

####  Example  
- **Heading Example (H1):** `Sweden Today ‚Äì Latest News`  
- **Paragraph Example (Body):** `Sweden‚Äôs immigrants on edge after mass shooting. The motive behind Sweden‚Äôs deadliest mass shooting may never be known but the fact that almost all of the victims ‚Ä¶`

 **Summary**  
- Wireframes provided a clear **blueprint** for feature development.  
- The **color scheme & typography** ensure a consistent and accessible UI.
