## Project Revisions & Resubmission Based on Feedback

This section outlines all improvements made after initial feedback, documenting the actions taken to address each issue before resubmitting the project for reassessment.

### 1. Full UI Customization

  - Draft issues are no longer added to the board before implementation

### 3. Adding Docstrings and Comments

##  Agile Methodology & Project Board

This project was managed using **GitHub Projects** with a Kanban workflow.  
The board included **four main stages**:

1. **Backlog** â†’ All planned user stories before development.  
2. **Ready** â†’ Items prepared and ready to be picked up.  
3. **In Progress** â†’ Items actively being developed.  
4. **Done** â†’ Completed items, fully implemented and tested.
